 2)An empty deck can not be deleted. 
 3)ŸçEach game can have multiple players and multiple decks. 
 4)Shuffeling a deck can happen anytime. 
 5)Shuffling on an empty deck has no effect. 
 6)A deck can be created regardless of any game being created.
 7) There are two implementations of GameManager, first fully synchronized version, GameManagerImpl
    second partial synchronized on a deck of card, ConcurrentGameManager. 
10)The unit testing are majorly based on ConcurrentGameManager
